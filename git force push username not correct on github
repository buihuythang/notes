CONTEXT
when force-pushing local repo to remote repo on github, github displays something like:
"USERNAME force-pushed the XYZ branch from HASH1 to HASH2 X minutes ago"
But USERNAME is not your current, it is likely the one you used previous, but not now.

WHAT HAPPENED?
It seems github remembered the public key associated with old username when you push to github the first time.
To check if that is the case:
$ git remote -v
Then copy the URL.
$ ssh -vT URL
Interpretation:
-T is to disable pseudo-terminal allocation, i.e. I don't want to execute command on remote ssh, I just want to check for some output...

In the ouput of `ssh` above will contain user information at the end of the output, similar to:
"Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
You should recognize that USERNAME is your previous name you used for github.

HOW
Regenerate SSH key pair:
$ ssh-keygen -t RSA
Add to github by following this guide:
https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

After that, check with `ssh -vT URL` again, it should display current username on github.
